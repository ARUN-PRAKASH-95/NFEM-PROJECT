\section*{Problem Description}
\indent \indent  The problem provided contains a spherical inclusion of radius $r_i$ which undergoes a phase transformation inside an ideally elastic-plastic matrix material. The matrix material is modeled as concentric sphere of radius $r_o$. The phase transformation of the inclusion only leads only to the volumetric strain without change of shape. From the model it is observed that, it exhibits spherical symmetry with respect to the center of the inclusion.\\
\\
 The non-trivial equilibrium condition for the spherical coordinate system r-$\phi$-$\theta$ is given by 
\begin{equation}
0 = \frac{\partial (r^2\sigma_{rr})}{\partial r} - (\sigma_{\phi\phi}+\sigma_{\theta\theta})
\label{strongform}
\end{equation}
The weak form of Eq(1) reads 
\begin{equation}
0 = \delta W = \int_{r_i}^{r_o} \delta\epsilon^T . \sigma r^2 dr - [r^2\sigma_{rr}\delta u_r]_{r=r_i}^{r_o}
\label{weakform}
\end{equation}
The stress components $\sigma_{rr}$,$\sigma_{\phi\phi}$ and $\sigma_{\theta\theta}$ are non-vanishing and the displacement in radial direction $u_r(r)$ is the only non-vanishing displacement component. Since the problem exhibits spherical symmetry, strains in each axis is connected to each other by the radial displacement $u_r$ and the relation reads 

\begin{equation}
\epsilon = \begin{bmatrix}
\epsilon_{rr} = \frac{\partial u_r }{\partial r}\\
\epsilon_{\phi\phi} = \frac{u_r}{r}\\
\epsilon_{\theta\theta} = \frac{u_r}{r}
\end{bmatrix}
\label{strain matrix}
\end{equation}


The boundary conditions for this problem are $\sigma_{rr}$(r=$r_o$) = 0 and $u_r$(r=$r_i$)= $\frac{1}{3}\tau\epsilon_{v}r_{i}$ 
\section*{Derivation}
In Finite element method the governing equation used to solve for displacements in static condition is given by 
$$  
G=F_{int} - F_{ext} = 0
$$
From the given weak form(eq(2)), the required parameters to solve the problem in finite element method has been derived. The term that corresponds to the internal force is $$ \int_{r_i}^{r_o} \underline{\delta}\epsilon^T .\underline{\sigma}  r^2 dr$$
 From this term, the parameters internal force($F_{int}$) and stiffness matrix can be derived. The internal force equation reads
 $$F_{int}= \int_{r_i}^{r_o} \underline{B}^T . \underline{\sigma} r^2 dr$$ by applying gauss quadrature with single gauss point we get 
$$  
F_{int} = 2.\underline{B}^T.\underline{\sigma}(\frac{r_1+r_2}{2})^2.J
$$
and the equation that computes stiffness matrix for each element reads $$K_e = \int_{r_i}^{r_o} \underline{B}^T.\underline{C}.\underline{B}.r^2 dr $$ by applying gauss quadrature we get 
$$  
K_e = 2.\underline{B}^T.\underline{C}.\underline{B}.(\frac{r_1+r_2}{2})^2.J
$$
where J is the Jacobian.\\
The strain-displacement relation (B matrix) can be computed from equation(3) using the relation $ \epsilon = [B].\underline{u^e} $. The derivation of [B] matrix follows
$$  
\epsilon = \begin{bmatrix}
\frac{\partial u_r }{\partial r}\\
\frac{u_r}{r}\\
\frac{u_r}{r}
\end{bmatrix}
$$
$$  
\epsilon = \begin{bmatrix}
\frac{\partial }{\partial r}\\
\frac{1}{r}\\
\frac{1}{r}\\
\end{bmatrix}. N .\underline{u}
$$
where N is linear shape function matrix for 1D element and it is given by $$ [N](\xi) = \begin{bmatrix}
\frac{1}{2}(1-\xi),& \frac{1}{2}(1+\xi)
\end{bmatrix}^T $$
From the above relations the [B]matrix can be obtained and it is given as 
$$  
[B] = \begin{bmatrix}
-\frac{1}{2}\frac{\partial \xi}{\partial r}&\frac{1}{2}\frac{\partial \xi}{\partial r}\\

\frac{1-\xi}{2(N_1r_1+N_2r_2)}&\frac{1+\xi}{2(N_1r_1+N_2r_2)}\\
\frac{1-\xi}{2(N_1r_1+N_2r_2)}&\frac{1+\xi}{2(N_1r_1+N_2r_2)}
\end{bmatrix}
$$
by applying gauss quadrature we get
$$  
[B] = \begin{bmatrix}
-\frac{1}{2}\frac{\partial \xi}{\partial r}&\frac{1}{2}\frac{\partial \xi}{\partial r}\\
\frac{1-\xi}{(r_1+r_2)}&\frac{1+\xi}{(r_1+r_2)}\\
\frac{1-\xi}{(r_1+r_2)}&\frac{1+\xi}{(r_1+r_2)}
\end{bmatrix}
$$
where $\frac{\partial \xi}{\partial r}$ is inverse of Jacobian and $r_1$  and $r_2$ are position of each nodes.
